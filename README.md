**Description:**

Unlike human decision-makers, algorithmic decision-making models fail to consider the broader (social) context of their decisions and may ignore some of the important nuances involved. Can we take advantage of both of these decision-making paradigms, i.e., human insight/judgment and automated data-driven decisions?
